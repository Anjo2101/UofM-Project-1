Analysis to our Questions:
# How does GDP impact electricity production from fossil fuels vs renewable sources?

###According to the data, we can conclude that countries that primarily use electricity production from natural resources, have a substantially higher GDP compared to countries that use less. 

###The USA, Russia, Japan, Italy, India, and Great Britain lead the world in both categories; For percentage of electricity production, they are all in the top 20th percentile range, and for their GDP, they fall in the top 50th percentile, not to mention the USA leading by quadruple the percentage with a GDP of over 15 trillion. 

###  We saw that countries that use more renewable energy still can have a thriving economy despite not exploiting those natural resources, with India, Italy, and Great Britain living way ahead of the top 10 countries by double the margins living in the range of 20 percent and higher.

#How does GDP influence the consumption of energy based on Oil and Electricity?

### Looking at the stacked graphs of the GDP and the Kw’s per capita used and Oil per kg per capita used, it shows that overall the more GDP a country has produced, the more resources needed to keep up with a growing economy

### The data also shows that the rise and fall of the consumption between the top 10 countries was relatively similar, with the United States being the powerhouse among the top 10.

# How does GDP influence a country’s production of electricity using renewable resources?

### Investment in Renewable Energy  
- Higher GDP nations typically allocate more funds to renewable energy infrastructure, research, and development.  

### Government Policies and Subsidies  
- Countries with strong economies often provide incentives such as tax credits and subsidies for renewable energy projects.  

### Energy Consumption and Sustainability  
- High-GDP countries have higher energy demands, necessitating a transition to renewable sources to maintain sustainability.  

### Countries with the Highest Share of Renewable Energy  
- The highest percentage of energy from renewables comes from **Germany, Italy, and Great Britain**, despite these countries not being the three largest economies.  
- Germany's **Energiewende** policy has made it a leader in wind and solar energy.  
- Italy benefits from extensive solar and hydroelectric power.  
- Great Britain has made significant investments in offshore wind energy.  

## Conclusion  
GDP significantly impacts renewable resource development by enabling investments, policy support, and technological advancements. However, economic structure, energy demands, and policy priorities vary among top economies, influencing their renewable energy transition pace.  

## Future Outlook  
- Increased international cooperation and technological advancements could accelerate renewable adoption in both developed and emerging economies.  
- Sustainable policies and corporate involvement will be crucial in ensuring a balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability.
